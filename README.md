# Project 9 - REST API

In this project, we had to create a REST API using Express. This API provides a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. To make changes to the database, users are required to log in so the API will also allow users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account.

## Usage

- Clone the repo
- Install dependencies using $ npm install
- Start the server using $ npm start
- Create the database using $ npm run seed
- Navigate to the browser of choice and enter `http://localhost:5000/` to run the app locally
- You should see a `Welcome to the REST API project!` message
- To test the various routes, import the `RESTAPI.postman_collection.json` file into Postman
